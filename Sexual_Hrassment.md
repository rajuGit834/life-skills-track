## What kinds of behavior cause sexual harassment?

Sexual harassment refers to unwelcome or offensive behavior of a sexual nature that violates a person's dignity and creates a hostile, intimidating, or abusive environment. It can occur in various settings, including workplaces, educational institutions, public spaces, or social gatherings. Here are some common types of behavior that can constitute sexual harassment:

1. Verbal Harassment: This includes unwelcome comments, jokes, innuendos, or sexual advances, whether explicit or implicit, that create discomfort or humiliation.

2. Physical Harassment: Inappropriate touching, groping, hugging, or other unwanted physical contact without consent falls into this category.

3. Visual Harassment: Displaying or sharing explicit or sexually suggestive images, videos, or materials without consent can create a hostile environment.

4. Non-Verbal Harassment: Persistent staring, leering, making offensive gestures, or creating sexually explicit drawings or messages can be forms of non-verbal sexual harassment.

5. Quid Pro Quo Harassment: This occurs when an individual in a position of power requests sexual favors in exchange for career advancement, job security, promotions, or other favorable treatment.

## What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behavior?

If you face or witness incidents of sexual harassment, it's essential to take appropriate actions. Here are some steps you can consider:

1. Assess Your Safety: Prioritize your safety and well-being. If you feel threatened or in immediate danger, remove yourself from the situation and seek help from authorities if necessary.

2. Document the Incidents: Maintain a record of the incidents, including dates, times, locations, descriptions of the behavior, and any witnesses involved. Documentation can be crucial if you decide to report the harassment later.

3. Confront the Harasser (if comfortable): If you feel safe and comfortable doing so, firmly and clearly communicate that their behavior is unwelcome and inappropriate. Clearly express your boundaries and assertively ask them to stop.

4. Seek Support: Reach out to someone you trust, such as a friend, family member, or colleague, and discuss the situation. Their support and advice can provide you with guidance on how to handle the situation.

5. Report the Incident: If the harassment persists or escalates, report the incidents to the appropriate authorities or the designated person within your organization, such as a supervisor, human resources department, or a trusted authority figure. Provide them with your documented evidence and details of the incidents.

6. Utilize Available Resources: Many organizations have policies and procedures in place to address sexual harassment. Familiarize yourself with these resources, such as reporting mechanisms, support services, or helplines, and utilize them for assistance and guidance.

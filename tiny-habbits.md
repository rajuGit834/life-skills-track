what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

## Answer

The video discusses how to build little routines, and the speaker outlines some important guidelines, they are:-

* Instead of seeking inspiration to form a habit, one should start small and work their way up.

Three elements of behavior that are (MAP).
* 'M' stands for Motivation, and 'A' stands for Ability. The letter 'P' stands for Prompt, which is the indicator to act.
* According to the video, small habits are effective, because:-
    * They are quick to complete, can accommodate any routine, and allow you to attempt immediately.
    * They are safe, as compared to more significant or risky actions. If you have made a mistake, you could indeed easily try again. 
    * They're so small that you aren't required to rely on your modest willpower. Nonetheless, they add up over time to generate incredible effects.

How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P.

* They are quick to complete, can fit into either schedule, and allow you to begin right away. Unlike large or risky actions, they are risk-free.
* If you have made a mistake, you can certainly try again. They're so small that you don't have to depend on your modest willpower.

He goes on to explain that an action prompt is required to successfully create a new habit, which means combining a routine with an existing behavior to ensure that the momentum from the past action helps you actually finish the simple effort that will form a new habit.

## Question 7

Write about the book's perspective on how to make a good habit easier.

## Answer

The book begins with the subject of compounding habits with time, and duration is both an ally as well as an enemy whenever the habit is good. The book discusses the plateau of disappointment, which refers to the letdown one feels when he believes the scheduled progress is not being made, which is normal even though advancement is not in a linear relationship with time. The book then discusses sustainability, as to plan the voyage or construct the system to proceed playing the game as setting a goal can be meaningless if the objectives are too challenging to achieve, or if the goal is met, one will stop trying. The book then points out that modifying one's identity is the first move toward switching one's habits.

* Break the change down into small, manageable steps.
* Combine the habits with a call to action.
* Celebrate minor victories.

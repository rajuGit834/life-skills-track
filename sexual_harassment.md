## What to do if you face or witness sexual harassment?

If you experience or witness any of these behaviors, it’s essential to respond in a safe and supportive way. Here are the steps to take:

1. **Stay Calm and Evaluate the Situation**: Take a moment to process what’s happening. If you feel safe to do so, remain calm, and avoid engaging further with the harasser.
2. **Set Boundaries**: If you are comfortable, tell the person their behavior is unwelcome and ask them to stop.
3. **Document the Incidents**: Keep a detailed record of each incident, noting dates, times, specific behaviors, and any witnesses. This can help you if you need to report it later.
4. **Report to a Supervisor or HR**: Notify a trusted supervisor, human resources, or a designated authority within your organization. Most companies have clear guidelines for reporting harassment, and they can assist in handling the situation.
5. **Seek Support**: Talk to trusted colleagues, friends, or mental health professionals if you need help coping with the situation. Harassment can be distressing, and support can be valuable.
6. **Follow Workplace Policies**: Review your company’s policies on harassment and follow the procedures they outline. This might include filing a formal complaint or participating in an investigation if required.
7. **Consider Additional Actions if Necessary**: If the situation is not addressed adequately at work, you may consider contacting external support organizations, legal advisors, or authorities to ensure a safe and fair outcome.
